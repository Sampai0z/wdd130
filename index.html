      <p>
        I started as a programmer in Feb 2022, even though I didn’t have
        professional experience I did work on solo projects and also did some
        co-op work (not paid) to have more experience in the area, my projects
        have been focused on Frontend and I always try to refine my skills for a
        better interface and experience. Even if I don't know a program I can
        adapt quickly and I can work things out, I like to work with different
        technologies.
