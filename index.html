        <p>
          I started as a programmer in Feb 2022, even though I didn’t have
          professional experience I did work on solo projects and also did some
          co-op work (not paid) to have more experience in the area, my projects
          have been focused on Frontend and I always try to refine my skills for
          a better interface and experience. Even if I don't know a program I
          can adapt quickly and I can work things out, I like to work with
          different technologies.
